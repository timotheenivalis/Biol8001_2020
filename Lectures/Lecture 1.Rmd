## A few key ideas

* Statistics in biology is the study of biological variation
* Understanding biological variation informs experimental design
* Understanding biological variation informs data analysis
 
::: block
### Statistical thinking is an essential component of scientific thinking
:::

 
## Some history of statistical methods in biology - 20th century

* Agricultural experiments in Rothamsted Station, UK 
* Stochastic processes in genetics
* Clinical trials

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "30%", out.height="30%", fig.cap = "R.A. Fisher 1890 - 1962"}
 knitr::include_graphics("../images/Lecture1_RA_Fisher.png")
```
The ideas from these intellectual movements gave us foundations for how we think about and interpret data as scientific evidence.

When teaching statistics, these ideas can get distilled, degraded into a simplistic and false narrative.

# Some false narratives ("cautionary tales")

## "Statistical analysis is all about getting a p-value"

### Vaccine challenge experiment

* 6 mice per vaccine group (saline/ low dose / high dose)
* All mice challenged with Shigella bacteria at Day 14
* Outcome: 7-day average symptom score post-challenge

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='right', out.width = "50%", out.height="50%", fig.cap = "Mean Symptom Score, by Treatment"}
 knitr::include_graphics("../images/Lecture1_barplot.png")
```

::: block
## Statistical analysis: one-way ANOVA, p=0.04 post hoc Bonferroni adjusted
:::

## Was there a cage effect or a vaccine effect?

The observed difference in symptom scores could be due to:

* animal cage
* vaccine treatment

These two factors are **CONFOUNDED**. It is impossible to separate out these two effects. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='right', out.width = "50%", out.height="50%", fig.cap = "Mean Symptom Score, by Treatment"}
 knitr::include_graphics("../images/Lecture1_cages.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "50%", out.height="50%", fig.cap = "Mean Symptom Score, by Treatment"}
 knitr::include_graphics("../images/Lecture1_cages.png")
```


## "P > 0.05 means 'same'; P < 0.05 means 'different'"  

Experimental set-up: Are temperature mechanisms modified in a genetically-engineered tomato plant?

* Genotypes: WT or mutant
* watering conditions: normal or drought
* Outcome: leaf temperature at 7 days post-treatment

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='right', out.width = "40%", out.height="40%", fig.cap = "Leaf temperature under different watering conditions"}
 knitr::include_graphics("../images/Lecture1_interaction.png")
```
## "When in doubt, use lots of t-tests"

Research questions: Are mice susceptible to obesity when exposed to a high fat diet?
Are NODk mice **MORE** susceptible than mice without mutation?
```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height = 2.3, fig.width=3.5, fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)
mice<- read.csv("../Data/diet and diabetic mice.csv")
ggplot(mice, aes(x=Age, y=Wt, group = MouseID, colour=Diet))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~Strain)+
  theme_classic()
```

## "More than 2 groups? Use 1-way ANOVA"

Research question: Which barley variety has the biggest yield?

* Five barley varieties, grown in 6 locations
* Two growing seasons
* Outcome: yield (tonnes/hectare)

```{r,  echo = FALSE, fig.height = 1.5, fig.width=3, fig.align='center'}
library(MASS)
barley <- immer
ggplot(barley, aes(Var, Y1))+
   geom_boxplot()+
   theme_classic()
```

## Location contributes to the variation in yield

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 2, fig.width=3.5, fig.align='center'}

ggplot(barley, aes(Var, Y1, colour=Loc))+
   geom_jitter(width=0.02, height=0.02, size = 2.5)+
   theme_classic()
```
Yield is highest in Locations C and W.
Yield is lowest in Locations D and GR.
             
## Varieties should be compared *within* location

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 2, fig.width=3.5, fig.align='center'}

ggplot(barley, aes(Loc, Y1, colour=Var))+
   geom_jitter(width=0.02, height=0.02, size = 2.5)+
   theme_classic()
```

Notice that: Variety M is near the bottom in most locations  
             Variety T is near the top in most locations 
             
## "When I see a scatterplot, I fit a linear regression"
Ecology researchers recorded **density of thorn-like plants** in multiple locations across five regions, and measured **per hectare consumption** of plant material by herbivores. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 1.8, fig.width=3.2, fig.align='center'}
thorn <- read.csv("../Data/thorndata.csv")
ggplot(thorn, aes(thorndensity, herbivory))+
   geom_point()+
   geom_smooth(method = "lm", alpha=0.01)+
   theme_classic()
```
## Herbivory vs Thorns, by Site
Ecology researchers recorded **density of thorn-like plants** in multiple locations across **five sites**, and measured **per hectare consumption** of plant material by herbivores. 

```{r, echo = FALSE,message = FALSE, fig.height = 1.8, fig.width=3.2, fig.align='center'}
thorn <- read.csv("../Data/thorndata.csv")
ggplot(thorn, aes(thorndensity, herbivory, colour=site))+
   geom_point()+
   geom_smooth(method = "lm", alpha=0.01)+
   theme_classic()
```
## Summary

* Message 1: Building a scientific case for a treatment effect is not just about the p-value. Must understand the context of experiment(s).

* Message 2: P-values from simple contrasts cannot tell us if the contrasts are different. 

* Message 3: Interpreting experimental results needs more than t-tests. 

* Message 4: We need to incorporate known sources of variation into statistical analyses.

* Message 5: What's more important than p-values and t-tests?
   * recognising patterns in data
   * understanding sources of variation
   * useing data to build information about complex systems
   * using statistics to allow the data to speak
